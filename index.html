      <p>The "Rick Roll" is one of the internet's most enduring and widespread memes. It involves unexpectedly presenting people with the music video for Rick Astley's 1987 hit song "Never Gonna Give You Up".</p>

      <h2>Origin and History</h2>
      <p>The meme originated on the imageboard 4chan in 2007. It started as a bait-and-switch prank where users would post links supposedly leading to interesting content, but instead directed people to Rick Astley's video.</p>

      <h2>How it Works</h2>
      <p>A typical Rick Roll might look like this:</p>
      <div class="meme-example">
        <p>"Check out this amazing cat video! <a href="/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amazing_cats</a>"</p>
      </div>
      <p>When an unsuspecting person clicks the link, instead of seeing cute cats, they're greeted by Rick Astley's iconic dance moves and catchy chorus.</p>
